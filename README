use the normalized cross corrilation to find the matching image, this is done 
by taking the desired sub image (obtained from my region analysis) and sweeping it through
the whole image, the highest points are the likely matches, the closest point is the 
match

next i need a way to put the mappings back into the image, so i need to
draw a bounding box around the objects, i also need to pass along an anchor
to each object.
